							<h3>Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance</h3>
							<p>Pharmaceutical companies must move to a more efficient, 
								strategically focused PV capability in order to be less reactionary, 
								resource-intensive, and transaction-focused, and become instead a more 
								proactive agent for patient safety. 
								<h5>Our core capabilities include:</h5>
											<ul>
												<li>Adverse Event Case Management including expedited reporting</li>
												<li>Aggregate Reporting</li>
												<li> Signal Intelligence</li>
												<li>Risk Management</li>
											</ul>

								</p>
							
									   <h3>Comprehensive Management of ICSRs</h3>
									   <p>Managing your individual case safety reports (ICSR’s) accurately and efficiently is 
										   critical to an effective PV system. Our consultants provide full support for each step 
										   of the ICSR handling process. From confirmation and translations to data entry and 
										   archival, we’ll manage your safety data and meet all your ICSR requirements.

											through EudraVigilance.
										</p>

										</p>

									   <h3>Risk management</h3>
									   <p> An effective Risk Management System and the development and update of Risk Management Plans, mandatory in the EU, are a critical part of pharmacovigilance and patient safety.
